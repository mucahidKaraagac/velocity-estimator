## _Velocity Estimaiton with Image Processing_

Estimator basicly find the speed of the vehicle by using images coming from the camera with image processing.

## Tech

Tracker uses some librarys:

- [OpenCV] - provides a real-time optimized Computer Vision library
- [Numpy] - Offers comprehensive mathematical functions

## BLA BLA

 - Estimator match previous and fresh frames for the find displacement of the feature points.  
 - Changing on the image filtered with using std and mean.
 - Using real world transformation from the camera lens to world envoriment.
 - Calculating diffrence and find the veloocity vector of the air vehicle from the distant.
